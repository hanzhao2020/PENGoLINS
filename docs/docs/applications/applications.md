# Applications
So far, we have tested a suite of benchmark problems and verified the effectiveness of PENGoLINS for analysis of non-matching Kirchhoff--Love shells. Now, we are going to investigate the applicability of PENGoLINS for more complicated structures. In this section, we first perform structural analysis for the wing, which is composed of the outer skin and internal ribs and spars, of an electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Then, we demonstrate the extensibility and compatibility of PENGoLINS by carrying out the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis of prosthetic heart valves using existing analysis frameworks, viz, [VarMINT](https://github.com/david-kamensky/VarMINT), [ShNAPr](https://github.com/david-kamensky/ShNAPr) and [CouDALFISh](https://github.com/david-kamensky/CouDALFISh).
