This demo simulates a pinned T-beam at on end is subjected a vertical point load at one corner on the free end. Problem configuration is depicted in the  Section 3.2 of [Herrema et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2018.08.038). The T-beam geometry in this demo consists of two mismatched NURBS patches, which are shown below.
