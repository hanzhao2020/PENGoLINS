# PENGoLINS results visualization
For results computed from PENGoLINS, using the Paraview trace script, view_results.py, to generate a Paraview state file or launch an interactive visualization window. This script requires Paraview 5.9.0 or higher.

Run ``pvpython view_results.py --help`` to see available options. For example, ``start_ind`` and ``end_ind`` are the first and last spline indices for the saved results. ``file_path`` is the location where the results are saved. By default, this script only displays the deformed geometry scaled by ``disp_scale``, whose default value is 1. Users can choose to show the unformed geometry by setting ``show_geom=True`` or von Mises stress (if computed and saved) using ``show_stress=True``. To launch the interactive window, set ``interact=True``.

Running ``pvpython view_results.py`` will generate a Paraview state file by default in the ``states`` directory, the filename is created in the order: "``filename_prefix``\_patch_``start_ind``\_``end_ind``\_disp``disp_scale``.pvsm".
